            "[[Slow loris]]es are [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] [[primate]]s in the [[genus]] ''Nycticebus'' that live in the [[rainforest]]s of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. They are threatened by habitat loss and [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] from [[deforestation]], [[selective logging]], and [[slash and burn]] agriculture, as well as by collection and hunting  for the [[wildlife trade]], including the [[exotic pet]] trade, and for use in [[traditional medicine]] and as [[bushmeat]]. Because of these and other threats, all five species of slow loris are listed as either \"[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]\" or \"[[Endangered species|Endangered]]\" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Their [[conservation status]] was originally listed as \"[[Least Concern]]\" in 2000 because of imprecise population surveys and the frequency in which these [[primate]]s were found in animal markets. Because of their rapidly declining populations and [[local extinction]]s, their status was updated and in 2007 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ([[CITES]]) elevated them to [[CITES#Appendix_I|Appendix I]], which prohibits international commercial trade. Local laws also protect slow lorises from hunting and trade, but enforcement is lacking in most areas.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Traditional beliefs regarding slow lorises have been part of the [[folklore]] of Southeast Asia for at least several hundred years. Their remains are buried under houses and roads to bring good luck, and every part of their body is used in traditional medicine to make products ranging from love potions to unproven cures for [[cancer]], [[leprosy]], [[epilepsy]], and [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. The primary users of this traditional medicine are urban, middle-aged women who are reluctant to consider alternatives. A large number of slow lorises are traded as pets, both locally and internationally. Although it is illegal to import slow lorises for commercial sale, they are popular exotic pets in Japan, the United States, and Europe, largely because of their \"cute\" appearance, which has been popularized in highly viewed [[YouTube]] videos. Hundreds of slow lorises have been confiscated at airports, but because they are easy to hide, these numbers are likely to be only a small fraction of the total number being [[Wildlife smuggling|trafficked]]. Traders cut or pull the teeth of slow lorises to make them appear to be an appropriate pet for small children, but this practice often leads to extreme blood loss, infection, and death. Slow lorises lacking their teeth would be unable to fend for themselves and therefore are not released into the wild. Most captive lorises in the pet trade also experience improper care and die from poor nutrition, stress, or infection. Despite this, demand has risen, and slow lorises are no longer captured opportunistically, but are now hunted on a commercial scale using flashlights, from which the animals do not flee.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Connected [[protected areas]] are important for the conservation of slow lorises because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the awareness of their legal protection. [[Animal sanctuary|Sanctuaries]] and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown too old to reproduce, although the [[pygmy slow loris]] is doing well at some facilities, such as the [[San Diego Zoo]].\n" +
